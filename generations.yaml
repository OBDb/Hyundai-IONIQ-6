    description: "The Hyundai IONIQ 6 is the second dedicated electric vehicle in Hyundai's IONIQ sub-brand, built on the same Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) as the IONIQ 5. Unlike its crossover sibling, the IONIQ 6 features a dramatic streamliner design inspired by the Prophecy concept car, with an extremely aerodynamic silhouette that achieves a drag coefficient of just 0.21—among the lowest of any production car. The exterior combines smooth, flowing surfaces with pixel-like lighting elements that maintain the IONIQ design language, while the elongated fastback profile maximizes efficiency and range. Like the IONIQ 5, it utilizes an 800V electrical architecture that enables ultra-fast DC charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 18 minutes at compatible charging stations. Available with either a 53 kWh or 77.4 kWh battery pack (varying slightly by market), and in single-motor rear-wheel drive or dual-motor all-wheel drive configurations, power outputs range from 149 HP to 320 HP in the performance-oriented dual-motor version. The aerodynamic design helps the IONIQ 6 achieve exceptional efficiency, with some configurations exceeding 360 miles of range—making it one of the most efficient electric vehicles on the market. The interior continues the 'living space' concept with a flat floor and spacious cabin, featuring dual 12.3-inch screens under a single piece of glass, customizable ambient lighting, and sustainable materials including recycled plastics and bio-based textiles. Advanced technology includes vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality that allows the car to power external devices, over-the-air updates, and Hyundai's most advanced driver assistance systems. The IONIQ 6 represents Hyundai's vision for an emotional, design-focused electric sedan that prioritizes efficiency and range while offering a distinctive alternative to both conventional sedans and electric crossovers. As the second model in the growing IONIQ lineup, it further establishes Hyundai's commitment to electrification with a distinctive approach focused on design and efficiency rather than simply converting existing models to electric power."
